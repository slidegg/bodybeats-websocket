### Process
* First a player need to join a game. If he's the first player who creates the session then he needs to pass a string with the word "init" OR if he wants to join to another game then a string with the join key (4 digit pin code).


* After that every player need to pass the name of the instrument as a simple string.


* Finally, the player starts to play and passes json messages like this
    ``` 
    {"type": "play", "sound": "messageFromApp"}
    ```
